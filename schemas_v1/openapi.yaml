      For example, if you are using the data returned from a

      request for another request body, and have a parsing rule

      that uses a regex pattern like `\s` for spaces, you will

      need to configure all escaped spaces as `%{space}` to use

      Synthetic tests come in

      two different flavors, [API

      tags to a particular host.


      The component of your infrastructure responsible for a tag is identified

      by a source. For example, some valid sources include nagios, hudson,
      jenkins,

      users, feed, chef, puppet, git, bitbucket, fabric, capistrano, etc.

      **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was
      incurred.

      It is retained for 15 months.


      You can retrieve up to 24 hours of hourly usage data for multiple
      organizations,

      and up to two months of hourly usage data for a single organization in one
      request.

    Get monthly usage attribution. Multi-region data is available starting March
    1, 2023.


    This API endpoint is paginated. To make sure you receive all records, check
    if the value of `next_record_id` is

    set in the response. If it is, make another request and pass
    `next_record_id` as a parameter.

    Pseudo code example:


    ```

    response := GetMonthlyUsageAttribution(start_month)

    cursor := response.metadata.pagination.next_record_id

    WHILE cursor != null BEGIN
      sleep(5 seconds)  # Avoid running into rate limit
      response := GetMonthlyUsageAttribution(start_month, next_record_id=cursor)
      cursor := response.metadata.pagination.next_record_id
    END

    ```

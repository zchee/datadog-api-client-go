    The metrics end-point allows you to post time-series data that can be
    graphed on Datadog’s dashboards.

    The maximum payload size is 3.2 megabytes (3200000 bytes). Compressed
    payloads must have a decompressed size of less than 62 megabytes (62914560
    bytes).


    If you’re submitting metrics directly to the Datadog API without using
    DogStatsD, expect:


    - 64 bits for the timestamp

    - 64 bits for the value

    - 40 bytes for the metric names

    - 50 bytes for the timeseries

    - The full payload is approximately 100 bytes. However, with the DogStatsD
    API,

    compression is applied, which reduces the payload size.

    Test if permissions are present to add log-forwarding triggers for the

    given services and AWS account. Input is the same as for
    `EnableAWSLogServices`.

    Done async, so can be repeatedly polled in a non-blocking fashion until

    the async request completes.


    - Returns a status of `created` when it's checking if the permissions exists
      in the AWS account.
    - Returns a status of `waiting` while checking.

    - Returns a status of `checked and ok` if the Lambda exists.

    - Returns a status of `error` if the Lambda does not exist.

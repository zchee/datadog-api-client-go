    The event stream can be queried and filtered by time, priority, sources and
    tags.


    **Notes**:

    - If the event youâ€™re querying contains markdown formatting of any kind,

    you may see characters such as `%`,`\`,`n` in your output.


    - This endpoint returns a maximum of `1000` most recent results. To return
    additional results,

    identify the last timestamp of the last result and set that as the `end`
    query time to

    paginate the results. You can also use the page parameter to specify which
    set of `1000` results to return.

        Set unaggregated to `true` to return all events within the specified
        [`start`,`end`] timeframe.

        Otherwise if an event is aggregated to a parent event with a timestamp
        outside of the timeframe,

        it won't be available in the output. Aggregated events with
        `is_aggregate=true` in the response will still be returned unless
        exclude_aggregate is set to `true.`

        Set `exclude_aggregate` to `true` to only return unaggregated events
        where `is_aggregate=false` in the response. If the `exclude_aggregate`
        parameter is set to `true`,

        then the unaggregated parameter is ignored and will be `true` by
        default.

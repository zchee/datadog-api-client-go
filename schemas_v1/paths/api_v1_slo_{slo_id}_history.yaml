    Get a specific SLOâ€™s history, regardless of its SLO type.


    The detailed history data is structured according to the source data type.

    For example, metric data is included for event SLOs that use

    the metric source, and monitor SLO types include the monitor transition
    history.


    **Note:** There are different response formats for event based and time
    based SLOs.

    Examples of both are shown.

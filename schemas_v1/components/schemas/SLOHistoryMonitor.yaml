description: >-
  An object that holds an SLI value and its associated data. It can represent an
  SLO's overall SLI value.

  This can also represent the SLI value for a specific monitor in multi-monitor
  SLOs, or a group in grouped SLOs.
properties:
  error_budget_remaining:
    $ref: ./SLOErrorBudgetRemainingData.yaml
  errors:
    description: >-
      An array of error objects returned while querying the history data for the
      service level objective.
    items:
      $ref: ./SLOHistoryResponseErrorWithType.yaml
    type: array
  group:
    description: For groups in a grouped SLO, this is the group name.
    example: name
    type: string
  history:
    description: >-
      The state transition history for the monitor. It is represented as

      an array of pairs. Each pair is an array containing the timestamp of the
      transition

      as an integer in Unix epoch format in the first element, and the state as
      an integer in the

      second element. An integer value of `0` for state means uptime, `1` means
      downtime, and `2` means no data.

      Periods of no data are counted either as uptime or downtime depending on
      monitor settings.

      See [SLO
      documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/service_management/service_level_objectives/monitor/#missing-data)

      for detailed information.

  monitor_modified:
    description: >-
      For `monitor` based SLOs, this is the last modified timestamp in epoch
      seconds of the monitor.

    description: >-
      The amount of decimal places the SLI value is accurate to for the given

    type: number
  preview:
    description: >-
      For `monitor` based SLOs, when `true` this indicates that a replay is in
      progress to give an accurate uptime

      calculation.

    description: The current SLI value of the SLO over the history window.

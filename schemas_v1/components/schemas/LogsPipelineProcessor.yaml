  Nested Pipelines are pipelines within a pipeline. Use Nested Pipelines to
  split the processing into two steps.

  For example, first use a high-level filtering such as team and then a second
  level of filtering based on the

  integration, service, or any other tag or attribute.


  A pipeline can contain Nested Pipelines and Processors whereas a Nested
  Pipeline can only contain Processors.

      The integration name associated with your log: the technology from which
      the log originated.

      When it matches an integration name, Datadog automatically installs the
      corresponding parsers and facets.

      See [reserved
      attributes](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/#reserved-attributes).

      The message [reserved
      attribute](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/#reserved-attributes)

      of your log. By default, Datadog ingests the value of the message
      attribute as the body of the log entry.

      That value is then highlighted and displayed in the Logstream, where it is
      indexed for full text search.
    example: 2019-11-19T14:37:58,995 INFO [process.name][20081] Hello World

      value when you use both products.

  Controls how groups or monitors are treated if an evaluation does not return
  any data points.

  The default option results in different behavior depending on the monitor
  query type.

  For monitors using Count queries, an empty monitor evaluation is treated as 0
  and is compared to the threshold conditions.

  For monitors using any query type other than Count, for example Gauge,
  Measure, or Rate, the monitor shows the last known status.

  This option is only available for APM Trace Analytics, Audit Trail, CI, Error
  Tracking, Event, Logs, and RUM monitors.

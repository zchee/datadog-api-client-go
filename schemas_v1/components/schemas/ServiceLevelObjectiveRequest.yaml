  A service level objective object includes a service level indicator,
  thresholds

  for one or more timeframes, and metadata (`name`, `description`, `tags`,
  etc.).
properties:
  description:
    description: |-
      A user-defined description of the service level objective.

      Always included in service level objective responses (but may be `null`).
      Optional in create/update requests.
    nullable: true
    type: string
  groups:
    description: >-
      A list of (up to 100) monitor groups that narrow the scope of a monitor
      service level objective.


      Included in service level objective responses if it is not empty. Optional
      in

      create/update requests for monitor service level objectives, but may only
      be

      used when then length of the `monitor_ids` field is one.
    example:
      - env:prod
      - role:mysql
    items:
      description: A group name, for instance `env:prod`.
      type: string
    type: array
  monitor_ids:
    description: |-
      A list of monitor IDs that defines the scope of a monitor service level
      objective. **Required if type is `monitor`**.
    items:
      description: A monitor ID.
      format: int64
      type: integer
    type: array
  name:
    description: The name of the service level objective object.
    example: Custom Metric SLO
    type: string
  query:
    $ref: ./ServiceLevelObjectiveQuery.yaml
  sli_specification:
    $ref: ./SLOSliSpec.yaml
  tags:
    description: |-
      A list of tags associated with this service level objective.
      Always included in service level objective responses (but may be empty).
      Optional in create/update requests.
    example:
      - env:prod
      - app:core
    items:
      description: A tag to apply to your SLO.
      type: string
    type: array
  target_threshold:
    description: >-
      The target threshold such that when the service level indicator is above
      this

      threshold over the given timeframe, the objective is being met.
    example: 99.9
    format: double
    type: number
  thresholds:
    description: |-
      The thresholds (timeframes and associated targets) for this service level
      objective object.
    example:
      - target: 95
        timeframe: 7d
      - target: 95
        timeframe: 30d
        warning: 97
    items:
      $ref: ./SLOThreshold.yaml
    type: array
  timeframe:
    $ref: ./SLOTimeframe.yaml
  type:
    $ref: ./SLOType.yaml
  warning_threshold:
    description: >-
      The optional warning threshold such that when the service level indicator
      is

      below this value for the given threshold, but above the target threshold,
      the

      objective appears in a "warning" state. This value must be greater than
      the target

      threshold.
    example: 99.95
    format: double
    type: number
required:
  - name
  - thresholds
  - type
type: object

  **Note**: Reference Tables are in public beta.

  Use the Lookup Processor to define a mapping between a log attribute

  and a human readable value saved in a Reference Table.

  For example, you can use the Lookup Processor to map an internal service ID

  into a human readable service name. Alternatively, you could also use it to
  check

  if the MAC address that just attempted to connect to the production

  environment belongs to your list of stolen machines.

  There are two ways to define correlation between application spans and logs:

    1. Follow the documentation on [how to inject a span ID in the application logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces).
    Log integrations automatically handle all remaining setup steps by default.

    2. Use the span remapper processor to define a log attribute as its associated span ID.
properties:
  is_enabled:
    default: false
    description: Whether or not the processor is enabled.
    type: boolean
  name:
    description: Name of the processor.
    type: string
  sources:
    default:
      - dd.span_id
    description: Array of source attributes.
    items:
      description: Attribute to extract the span ID from.
      type: string
    type: array

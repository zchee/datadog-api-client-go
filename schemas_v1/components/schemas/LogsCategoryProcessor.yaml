  Use the Category Processor to add a new attribute (without spaces or special
  characters in the new attribute name)

  to a log matching a provided search query. Use categories to create groups for
  an analytical view.

  For example, URL groups, machine groups, environments, and response time
  buckets.


  **Notes**:


  - The syntax of the query is the one of Logs Explorer search bar.
    The query can be done on any log attribute or tag, whether it is a facet or not.
    Wildcards can also be used inside your query.
  - Once the log has matched one of the Processor queries, it stops.
    Make sure they are properly ordered in case a log could match several queries.
  - The names of the categories must be unique.

  - Once defined in the Category Processor, you can map categories to log status
  using the Log Status Remapper.

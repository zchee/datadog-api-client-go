      updates to the monitor configuration, monitor deletion, and muting of the
      monitor for any amount of time. You can use the [Restriction Policies
      API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/restriction-policies/) to
      manage write authorization for individual monitors by teams and users, in
      addition to roles.

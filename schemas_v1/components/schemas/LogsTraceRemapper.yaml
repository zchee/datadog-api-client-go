  There are two ways to improve correlation between application traces and logs.

    1. Follow the documentation on [how to inject a trace ID in the application logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces)
    and by default log integrations take care of all the rest of the setup.

    2. Use the Trace remapper processor to define a log attribute as its associated trace ID.
properties:
  is_enabled:
    default: false
    description: Whether or not the processor is enabled.
    type: boolean
  name:
    description: Name of the processor.
    type: string
  sources:
    default:
      - dd.trace_id
    description: Array of source attributes.
    items:
      description: Attribute to extract the trace ID from.
      type: string
    type: array
  type:
    $ref: ./LogsTraceRemapperType.yaml
required:

  disable_daily_limit:
    description: >-
      If true, sets the `daily_limit` value to null and the index is not limited
      on a daily basis (any

      specified `daily_limit` value in the request is ignored). If false or
      omitted, the index's current

      `daily_limit` is maintained.
    example: false
    type: boolean
  exclusion_filters:
    description: >-
      An array of exclusion objects. The logs are tested against the query of
      each filter,

      following the order of the array. Only the first matching active exclusion
      matters,

      others (if any) are ignored.
    items:
      $ref: ./LogsExclusion.yaml
    type: array
  filter:

  num_flex_logs_retention_days:
    description: >-
      The total number of days logs are stored in Standard and Flex Tier before
      being deleted from the index.

      If Standard Tier is enabled on this index, logs are first retained in
      Standard Tier for the number of days specified through
      `num_retention_days`,

      and then stored in Flex Tier until the number of days specified in
      `num_flex_logs_retention_days` is reached.

      The available values depend on retention plans specified in your
      organization's contract/subscriptions.


      **Note**: Changing this value affects all logs already in this index. It
      may also affect billing.
    example: 360
    format: int64
    type: integer
  num_retention_days:
    description: >-
      The number of days logs are stored in Standard Tier before aging into the
      Flex Tier or being deleted from the index.

      The available values depend on retention plans specified in your
      organization's contract/subscriptions.

      How often to repeat as an integer.

      For example, to repeat every 3 days, select a type of `days` and a period
      of `3`.
    example: 1
    format: int32

    type: integer
  rrule:
    description: >-
      The `RRULE` standard for defining recurring events (**requires to set
      "type" to rrule**)

      For example, to have a recurring event on the first day of each month, set
      the type to `rrule` and set the `FREQ` to `MONTHLY` and `BYMONTHDAY` to
      `1`.

      Most common `rrule` options from the [iCalendar
      Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) are supported.


      **Note**: Attributes specifying the duration in `RRULE` are not supported
      (for example, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `DURATION`).

      More examples available in this [downtime
      guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/guide/suppress-alert-with-downtimes/?tab=api)
    example: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=3;BYDAY=WE;INTERVAL=1

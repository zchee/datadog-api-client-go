additionalProperties:
  description: >-
    A list of values that are associated with each tag key.


    - An empty list means the resource use wasn't tagged with the respective
    tag.

    - Multiple values means the respective tag was applied multiple times on the
    resource.

    - An `<empty>` value means the resource was tagged with the respective tag
    but did not have a value.
  items:
    description: A given tag in a list.
    example: datadog-integrations-lab
    type: string
  type: array
description: >-
  Tag keys and values.


  A `null` value here means that the requested tag breakdown cannot be applied
  because it does not match the [tags

  configured for usage
  attribution](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/billing/usage_attribution/#getting-started).

  In this scenario the API returns the total usage, not broken down by tags.

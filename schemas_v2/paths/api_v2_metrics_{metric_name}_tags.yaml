    Update the tag configuration of a metric or percentile aggregations of a
    distribution metric or custom aggregations

    of a count, rate, or gauge metric. By setting `exclude_tags_mode` to true
    the behavior is changed

    from an allow-list to a deny-list, and tags in the defined list will not be
    queryable.

    Can only be used with application keys from users with the `Manage Tags for
    Metrics` permission. This endpoint requires

    a tag configuration to be created first.

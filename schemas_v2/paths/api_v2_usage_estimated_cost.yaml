    Get estimated cost across multi-org and single root-org accounts.

    Estimated cost data is only available for the current month and previous
    month

    and is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.

    To access historical costs prior to this, use the `/historical_cost`
    endpoint.


    This endpoint is only accessible for [parent-level
    organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).
  operationId: GetEstimatedCostByOrg
  parameters:

        at the sub-org level. Available views are `summary` and `sub-org`.

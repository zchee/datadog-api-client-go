get:
  description: >-
    Returns all metrics that can be configured in the Metrics Summary page or
    with Metrics without Limitsâ„¢ (matching additional filters if specified).

    Optionally, paginate by using the `page[cursor]` and/or `page[size]` query
    parameters.

    To fetch the first page, pass in a query parameter with either a valid
    `page[size]` or an empty cursor like `page[cursor]=`. To fetch the next
    page, pass in the `next_cursor` value from the response as the new
    `page[cursor]` value.

    Once the `meta.pagination.next_cursor` value is null, all pages have been
    retrieved.

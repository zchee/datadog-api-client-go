  If true, signals in non-production environments have a lower severity than
  what is defined by the rule case, which can reduce signal noise.

  The severity is decreased by one level: `CRITICAL` in production becomes
  `HIGH` in non-production, `HIGH` becomes `MEDIUM` and so on. `INFO` remains
  `INFO`.

  The decrement is applied when the environment tag of the signal starts with
  `staging`, `test` or `dev`.
example: false
type: boolean

description: >-
  A list of queryable aggregation combinations for a count, rate, or gauge
  metric.

  By default, count and rate metrics require the (time: sum, space: sum)
  aggregation and

  Gauge metrics require the (time: avg, space: avg) aggregation.

  Additional time & space combinations are also available:


  - time: avg, space: avg

  - time: avg, space: max

  - time: avg, space: min

  - time: avg, space: sum

  - time: count, space: sum

  - time: max, space: max

  - time: min, space: min

  - time: sum, space: avg

  - time: sum, space: sum


  Can only be applied to non_distribution metrics that have a `metric_type` of
  `count`, `rate`, or `gauge`.
example:
  - space: sum
    time: sum
  - space: sum
    time: count

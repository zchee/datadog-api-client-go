  AWS Metrics Collection tag filters list. Defaults to `[]`.

  The array of custom AWS resource tags (in the form `key:value`) defines a
  filter that Datadog uses when collecting metrics from a specified service.

  Wildcards, such as `?` (match a single character) and `*` (match multiple
  characters), and exclusion using `!` before the tag are supported.

  For EC2, only hosts that match one of the defined tags will be imported into
  Datadog. The rest will be ignored.

  For example, `env:production,instance-type:c?.*,!region:us-east-1`.

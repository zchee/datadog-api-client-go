  The Quota Processor measures logging traffic for logs that match a specified
  filter. When the configured daily quota is met, the processor can drop or
  alert.
properties:
  drop_events:
    description: >-
      If set to `true`, logs that matched the quota filter and sent after the
      quota has been met are dropped; only logs that did not match the filter
      query continue through the pipeline.
    example: false
    type: boolean
  id:
    description: >-
      The unique identifier for this component. Used to reference this component
      in other parts of the pipeline (for example, as the `input` to downstream
      components).

      If `true`, the processor skips quota checks when partition fields are
      missing from the logs.

      A list of alternate quota rules that apply to specific sets of events,

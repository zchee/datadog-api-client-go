    $ref: ./CustomDestinationElasticsearchDestinationAuth.yaml
  endpoint:
    description: |-
      The destination for which logs will be forwarded to.
      Must have HTTPS scheme and forwarding back to Datadog is not allowed.
    example: https://example.com
    type: string
  index_name:
    description: >-
      Name of the Elasticsearch index (must follow [Elasticsearch's
      criteria](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.11/indices-create-index.html#indices-create-api-path-params)).
    example: nginx-logs
    type: string
  index_rotation:
    description: >-
      Date pattern with US locale and UTC timezone to be appended to the index
      name after adding `-`

      (that is, `${index_name}-${indexPattern}`).

      You can customize the index rotation naming pattern by choosing one of
      these options:

      - Hourly: `yyyy-MM-dd-HH` (as an example, it would render:
      `2022-10-19-09`)

      - Daily: `yyyy-MM-dd` (as an example, it would render: `2022-10-19`)

      - Weekly: `yyyy-'W'ww` (as an example, it would render: `2022-W42`)

      - Monthly: `yyyy-MM` (as an example, it would render: `2022-10`)


      If this field is missing or is blank, it means that the index name will
      always be the same

      (that is, no rotation).
    example: yyyy-MM-dd
    type: string
  type:
    $ref: ./CustomDestinationForwardDestinationElasticsearchType.yaml
required:
  - type
  - endpoint
  - auth
  - index_name

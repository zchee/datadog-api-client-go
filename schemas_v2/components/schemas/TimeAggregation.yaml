  Time aggregation period (in seconds) is used to aggregate the results of the
  notification rule evaluation.

  Results are aggregated over a selected time frame using a rolling window,
  which updates with each new evaluation.

  Notifications are only sent for new issues discovered during the window.

  Time aggregation is only available for vulnerability-based notification rules.
  When omitted or set to 0, no aggregation

  is done.

  Notification rules allow full control over notifications generated by the
  various Datadog security products.

  They allow users to define the conditions under which a notification should be
  generated (based on rule severities,

  rule types, rule tags, and so on), and the targets to notify.

  A notification rule is composed of a rule ID, a rule type, and the rule
  attributes. All fields are required.

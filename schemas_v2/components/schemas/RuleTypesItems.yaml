  Security rule type which can be used in security rules.

  Signal-based notification rules can filter signals based on rule types
  application_security, log_detection,

  workload_security, signal_correlation, cloud_configuration and
  infrastructure_configuration.

  Vulnerability-based notification rules can filter vulnerabilities based on
  rule types application_code_vulnerability,

  application_library_vulnerability, attack_path, container_image_vulnerability,
  identity_risk, misconfiguration, and api_security.

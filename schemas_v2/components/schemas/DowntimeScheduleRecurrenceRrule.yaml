  The `RRULE` standard for defining recurring events.

  For example, to have a recurring event on the first day of each month, set the
  type to `rrule` and set the `FREQ` to `MONTHLY` and `BYMONTHDAY` to `1`.

  Most common `rrule` options from the [iCalendar
  Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) are supported.


  **Note**: Attributes specifying the duration in `RRULE` are not supported (for
  example, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `DURATION`).

  More examples available in this [downtime
  guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/guide/suppress-alert-with-downtimes/?tab=api).
example: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=3;BYDAY=WE;INTERVAL=1
type: string

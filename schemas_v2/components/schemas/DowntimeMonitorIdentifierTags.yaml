  monitor_tags:
    description: >-
      A list of monitor tags. For example, tags that are applied directly to
      monitors,

      not tags that are used in monitor queries (which are filtered by the scope
      parameter), to which the downtime applies.

      The resulting downtime applies to monitors that match **all** provided
      monitor tags. Setting `monitor_tags`

      to `[*]` configures the downtime to mute all monitors for the given scope.
    example:
      - service:postgres
      - team:frontend
